      "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is an English lullaby. The lyrics are from
      an early-19th-century English poem written by Jane Taylor, "The Star". The
      poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in Rhymes for
      the Nursery, a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann. It is now
      sung to the tune of the French melody "Ah! vous dirai-je, maman", which
      was first published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers,
      including Mozart with Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman". The
      English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known.

      Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
      How I wonder what you are!<br />
      Up above the world so high,<br />
      Like a diamond in the sky.

      When the blazing sun is gone,<br />
      When he nothing shines upon,<br />
      Then you show your little light,<br />
      Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
